# Frontend Code Review Findings

This document details the findings of the code review for the frontend service (Next.js application).

## Summary

The frontend is a modern Next.js 15 application using the App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4. It leverages Radix UI/shadcn for components, Zustand for state management, SWR for data fetching, and Supabase for authentication. Key features include extensive file rendering capabilities and a sophisticated UI for visualizing agent interactions, including streaming updates and tool call details via a custom `useAgentStream` hook and `ToolCallSidePanel`. The code appears well-structured, utilizing context providers and custom hooks effectively. Potential areas for review include the mixed API strategy (direct Supabase vs. backend API) and the robustness of client-side stream management.

## Detailed Findings

### Security

*   **Secrets:** Frontend uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_` environment variables (`.env.example`), which are exposed to the browser. Ensure no sensitive keys (beyond Supabase Anon Key and Backend URL) are stored this way. Backend API calls rely on Supabase JWTs passed in the Authorization header, which is standard practice.
*   **Dependencies:** `package.json` lists numerous dependencies. A vulnerability scan (e.g., `npm audit`) is recommended.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Review how user input (e.g., in `ChatInput`) and data rendered via Markdown (`react-markdown`) are handled to prevent XSS, although `rehype-sanitize` is listed as a dependency, suggesting awareness.

### Performance

*   **Bundle Size:** The number of dependencies is significant. Analyze bundle size (`next build` output) to identify potential areas for optimization or code-splitting.
*   **Streaming UI:** The incremental rendering logic in the thread page (`handleAssistantStreamChunk`) seems efficient, updating only the necessary message content.
*   **Data Fetching:** Uses SWR, which provides caching and revalidation, generally good for performance. Review specific SWR usage patterns for potential improvements.
*   **Image Optimization:** Uses `next/image`, which provides automatic image optimization.

### Reliability & Error Handling

*   **API Layer (`lib/api.ts`):** Includes basic error handling for `fetch` calls and Supabase client errors. Provides specific messages for network errors.
*   **Streaming (`useAgentStream.ts`):** Contains robust logic for handling stream errors (`onerror`) and unexpected closures (`onclose`), including checking the agent's actual status via `getAgentStatus` to determine the correct final state. Manages active streams and prevents reconnection attempts for completed/failed runs.
*   **UI State:** The main thread component manages various loading and error states. Error propagation to the user (e.g., via `toast`) seems present.

### Code Quality & Maintainability

*   **Structure:** Follows standard Next.js App Router conventions. Code seems well-organized into components, hooks, and library functions.
*   **TypeScript:** Project uses TypeScript, enhancing type safety. `tsconfig.json` has `strict: false`, which could be enabled for stricter checks, although `noImplicitAny: false` might require significant refactoring.
*   **Custom Hooks:** Effective use of custom hooks (`useAgentStream`, `useAuth`, `useIsMobile`) encapsulates logic.
*   **Context:** Uses React Context appropriately for global state (Auth, Theme, Tool Calls).
*   **Component Design:** Leverages `shadcn/ui` and Radix primitives, promoting consistency. Custom components like `ChatInput`, `ToolCallSidePanel`, `FileViewerModal` encapsulate specific UI features.
*   **Redundancy:** `ThemeProvider` appears in both `layout.tsx` and `providers.tsx`; likely only needed in one place.
*   **Readability:** Code generally appears readable, though the streaming logic in `useAgentStream` and message rendering in the thread page are complex.

### Accessibility (a11y)

*   Relies on underlying component libraries (Radix UI) which generally have good accessibility.
*   Manual review of custom components (chat interface, side panel, modals) is needed to ensure proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and focus management.

### Configuration & Build Process

*   **Next.js Config (`next.config.ts`):** Includes webpack externals/fallbacks for `canvas`, likely related to PDF rendering dependencies.
*   **ESLint (`eslint.config.mjs`):** Uses the new flat config format. Includes standard Next.js rules and some custom overrides (disabling `no-unused-vars`, `no-explicit-any`).
*   **TypeScript Config (`tsconfig.json`):** Standard configuration, but `strict: false` allows for looser type checking. Path aliases are configured.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

**High Priority:**

1.  **Security - Dependency Audit:**
    *   **Action:** Run `npm audit` or use a tool like Snyk to scan `package.json` dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Reason:** Mitigate risks associated with third-party libraries.
    *   **Implementation:** Address any critical or high-severity vulnerabilities found by updating packages or finding alternatives.
2.  **Code Quality - Enable Stricter TypeScript:**
    *   **Action:** Gradually enable stricter TypeScript checks in `tsconfig.json` (e.g., set `strict: true`, `noImplicitAny: true`).
    *   **Reason:** Improves code quality, catches potential errors earlier, and enhances maintainability.
    *   **Implementation:** Address resulting TypeScript errors incrementally. This might require significant effort depending on the current codebase state.

**Medium Priority:**

3.  **Performance - Bundle Size Analysis:**
    *   **Action:** Analyze the production build output (`next build`) to identify large chunks or dependencies contributing significantly to the bundle size.
    *   **Reason:** Optimize initial load times and overall application performance.
    *   **Implementation:** Use tools like `@next/bundle-analyzer`. Consider dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) for heavy components or libraries not needed immediately.
4.  **Code Quality - Consolidate ThemeProvider:**
    *   **Action:** Remove the redundant `ThemeProvider` from `providers.tsx`, keeping only the one in `layout.tsx`.
    *   **Reason:** Simplifies the provider tree and avoids potential minor conflicts.
5.  **Accessibility (a11y) - Audit Custom Components:**
    *   **Action:** Perform manual accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen reader testing) on custom interactive components like `ChatInput`, `ToolCallSidePanel`, `FileViewerModal`, and the message rendering logic.
    *   **Reason:** Ensure usability for all users.
    *   **Implementation:** Add necessary ARIA attributes, manage focus appropriately, and ensure keyboard operability.

**Low Priority:**

6.  **Architecture - Review API Strategy:**
    *   **Action:** Evaluate the rationale behind using both direct Supabase calls and custom backend API calls from the frontend.
    *   **Reason:** Identify potential opportunities for simplification or consistency.
    *   **Implementation:** Discuss the trade-offs. If appropriate, consider consolidating more logic behind the backend API.
7.  **Reliability - Enhance Stream Error Display:**
    *   **Action:** Ensure that errors occurring during streaming or agent execution are clearly and consistently communicated to the user in the UI (beyond just console logs or toasts).
    *   **Reason:** Improve user experience when issues arise.
